# Supabase Setup Guide ðŸš€

This guide will help you set up Supabase as the backend for your GDG recruitment application form.

## 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: `gdg-recruitment` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password
   - **Region**: Choose the closest region to your users
5. Click "Create new project"

## 2. Set up the Database

1. Once your project is created, go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the entire content from `supabase-schema.sql` file
3. Paste it in the SQL Editor and click "Run"
4. This will create the `applications` table with all necessary indexes and policies

### Table Structure
The `applications` table includes:
- `id` - Unique UUID for each application
- `name` - Applicant's full name
- `email` - Applicant's email (unique)
- `university` - Applicant's university/institution
- `year` - Academic year
- `position` - Applied position
- `skills` - Technical skills
- `experience` - Previous experience
- `motivation` - Why they want to join GDG
- `created_at` - Submission timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Settings > API**
2. Copy your project details:
   - **Project URL** (looks like `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - **Project API Key** (anon/public key)

3. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## 4. Row Level Security (RLS)

The setup automatically enables RLS with these policies:
- **Public Insert**: Anyone can submit applications (required for the form)
- **Public Select**: Anyone can read applications (optional - you can remove this)

### Optional: Restrict Read Access
If you want to restrict who can read applications:

1. Go to **Authentication > Policies** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Remove the "Allow public select" policy
3. Create a new policy for authenticated users only:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated select" ON public.applications
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## 5. Testing the Setup

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
// Test if Supabase is configured correctly
testSupabaseSubmission()

// Check all applications (if public read is enabled)
getAllApplications()

// Check if a specific email exists
checkEmailExists("test@example.com")
```

## 6. Viewing Applications

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Database > Tables > applications** in your Supabase dashboard
2. View all submitted applications in the table view

### Option 2: Browser Console (if public read is enabled)
```javascript
getAllApplications()
```

### Option 3: Create an Admin Panel (Recommended)
Consider creating a simple admin interface to view and manage applications.

## 7. Production Considerations

### Security
- Consider removing public read access if not needed
- Implement proper authentication for admin features
- Set up email notifications for new applications

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for database errors
- Monitor application submission rates
- Consider implementing rate limiting

### Backup
- Supabase automatically backs up your data
- Consider exporting important data regularly

## 8. Advanced Features

### Email Notifications
You can set up email notifications when new applications are submitted:

1. Go to **Database > Webhooks** in Supabase
2. Create a webhook for the `applications` table
3. Set up an endpoint to handle new submissions and send emails

### Real-time Updates
If you want real-time updates for admin dashboards:

```javascript
import { supabase } from './lib/supabase'

// Listen for new applications
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('applications')
  .on('postgres_changes', { 
    event: 'INSERT', 
    schema: 'public', 
    table: 'applications' 
  }, (payload) => {
    console.log('New application:', payload.new)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

## 9. Migration from Basin

If you were previously using Basin Forms:

1. âœ… Basin forms service has been removed
2. âœ… Supabase integration is now active
3. âœ… All form validations remain the same
4. âœ… Debug utilities have been updated
5. Remove Basin-related environment variables if any

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Missing Supabase environment variables"**
- Make sure `.env` file exists and has correct variables
- Restart your development server after updating `.env`

**Error: "Database error: relation 'applications' does not exist"**
- Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
- Make sure you're connected to the correct project

**Error: "Row Level Security policy violation"**
- Check that RLS policies are properly set up
- Verify the policies allow the operation you're trying to perform

**Form submission fails with network error**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Supabase URL and API key are correct
- Check Supabase project status

## Summary

Your GDG recruitment form now uses Supabase for:
- âœ… Storing application data securely
- âœ… Real-time database operations
- âœ… Built-in user management (if needed later)
- âœ… Automatic backups
- âœ… Scalable infrastructure
- âœ… Free tier with generous limits

The migration is complete! Your form will now store all submissions in your Supabase database instead of Basin Forms.
